SCUFFLE is the Soul Callibur live frame data UFFLE reader
---(https://github.com/rougelite/SCUFFLE)---
* SCUFFLE works in windowed or borderless windowed mode only (NOT IN FULLSCREEN)
* Launch SCUFFLE and Soul Calibur 6 at the same time and the overlay should display during fights
* It's probably gonna break after official patches, then you must wait for a kind hearted soul to update it

GOOD STUFF TO KNOW:
* Some moves, particularly launchers and moves with 'tip' properties such as Seong Mina's spear or Siegfried's sword, have multiple hitboxes. By default only the first is displayed but check Tools >> Display All Hitboxes to see the data for the rest.
* Transitioning to a stance replaces the recovery with a much more difficult to calculate number that SCUFFLE is not currently smart enough to find. This means any move that ends in a stance transition has bad frame data. However, the relative difference between block/hit/counter will remain the same.
* There's still a lot of innacurate data, be suspiciuos.
